Note-Taker

AS A user, I want to be able to write and save notes

I WANT to be able to delete notes I've written before

SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

Description:

When the app is deployed, the user can type in the information they would like to save. The application will allow for input of a note title and the notes contents. After the desired information is imputed, we can push the save button. This will log the info for later.
